## Birds of Prospect Park

This project was created as a capstone for the Flexbox module of the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about). 
At this point is is only viewable on desktop - I'll be learning how to make the project look nice on mobile devices soon!

All images were sourced from the [Macaulay Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) maintained by the Cornell Ornithology Lab and ebird.org, and are linked accordingly.
The logo art was designed by [Icongeek27 on Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/heron_4584751).
